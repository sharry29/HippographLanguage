## Compile

Run `make` to compile, `make clean` to remove generated intermediary files, and `make redo` to clean and recompile.

## Run

Ensure the compilation step has generated a `hippograph.native` binary in the root directory.

To display the appropriate semantic error or `.ll` code generated by llvm for any given `.hpg` file, run
```
./hippograph.native path/to/FILENAME.hpg
```

To compile and execute any given `.hpg` file, run the `make` command with the `FILE` flag specified.
```
make run FILE=path/to/FILENAME.hpg
```

## Test

Run `make test` to execute tests. This runs `.hpg` files in the `test/` directory, and compares the result to the expected output.
