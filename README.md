## Compile

Run `make` to compile, and `make clean` to remove generated intermediary files.

## Run

Ensure the compilation step has generated a `hippograph.native` binary in the root directory.

To display the appropriate semantic error or `.ll` code generated by llvm for any given `.hpg` file, run
```
./hippograph.native path/to/FILENAME.hpg
```

## Test

Run `make test` to execute tests. This runs `.hpg` files in the `test/` directory, and compares the result to the expected output.

## Current Status

Currently, the test script correctly identifies a valid program that prints "Hello, world". It also correctly fails an invalid program that passes an integer instead of a string into the `print` function; the fail case detects the type mismatch, and prints the relevant error message.

The project still compiles with many warnings, as vast portions of the codebase are commented out.
